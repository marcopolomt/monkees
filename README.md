## First Milestone Project: The Monkees.

**
This site is designed for those members of the public who may or may not be familiar with the band and would appreciate various forms of related media.
It also allows users to sign up to a newsletter, follow the band on social media, and even book the band to perform gigs.

**UX**

 - The site is designed to be responsive no matter what device is used.

 - It would allow fans of the band to enjoy clips and also sign up to social media and a newsletter.

- Those seeking live music are able to sign up the band to perform gigs.
 
- A pdf off the original loose wireframe is included on the github repository.

- The site is based off the resume project but with enough changes to cause numerous problems.

**Features**

- Media - To allow consumption of various media types showcasing the band.

- Gallery - to enable viewing of various images of the band. I had to scale this back after numerous attempts to implement a fancier gallery. I would llike to revisit this section when my knowledge is increased.

- Video - again I had trouble with the original provided video and couldn't get it to work so embedded a youtube video instead.

- Audio - embedded included audio files although i would have preffered a track selectable jukebox this was beyond my current capabilities.

- Newsletter - Allows the user to receive band updates and the band to market itself directly.
- 
- Social media buttons - Similar to the newsletter in scope but using various types of social media.

- Contact form - Allows end users to book the band for gigs.

**Technologies and assistance used.**

Many hints, tips, and bugfixes from w3c, stack overflow and similar sites. Built using bootstrap framework.

**Testing**

- I tested each and every link from each and every page. Utilised chrome dev tools to test responsiveness but also tried real world tests on a galaxy note 9 device and galaxy s2 tablet. I have not had chance to test in other browsers besides chrome as yet.

- I discovered that i had forgot to make the sidebar album cover images responsive. whilst doing so i also inserted a hyper link to the media page on all but the media page itself.

- I deliberately left off the sidebar on the contact page as i wanted to emphasise the booking form.

**Deployment.**

Deployed to github pages and later added this readme and the balsamiq pdf mockup.

**Media**

All media was provided by code institute bar the video owing to problems so youtube was used instead.

**Acknowledgements.**

Code institute and mentor Spencer Barriball. I didn't want to go the easier route with a site based largely off elements learned from the whiskey drop site but rather the more complex resume page. I have mixed feelings as to if i made the right choice but I must push myself.
